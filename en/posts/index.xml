      <description>The mystery of the origin of the Universe is certainly one of the most profound and mysterious that humanity can face. Because even if physics become complete and get a model and equations to understand the smallest excitement of the quantum world that composes it, the reason for the existence of such a Universe would remain unfathomable. And it is important to specify that the word &amp;ldquo;unfathomable&amp;rdquo; must be understood here in the original sense of the term: nothing nor anybody can ever provide the slightest sketch of an explanation.</description>
