      <description>The notion of artificial intelligence is a concept whose traces can be found up to more than 1000 years before our era, but which experienced an especially lightning rise from the 19th century with the work of many mathematicians and engineers who began to formalize its principles. Then, a convergence of innovative ideas at the dawn of the 20th century established a close connection with this field as soon as it appeared that the brain was made up of neurons processing electrical impulses.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is more in the realization of a generic platform for board games than in the implementation or the study of the best algorithm existing in this field. It is therefore important to clearly define the constraints that we want to fullfill in order to sketch the solution accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
